      <p>I have a top 3 favorite movies. My first one is Mean Girls. I love pink and the movie is really good, and I saw the second one at the movies. My second favorite movie is the Barbie movie. I like this movie because it has funny humor, and I like Margot Robbie. My third favorite movie is Moana. I like the movie moana becuase it reminds me of summer.<p>
